        <p>The Good Witch of the South is Glinda the Good. She is the most powerful of the Witches. According
            to the Soldier with Green
            Whiskers, Glinda:</p>
        <blockquote> "knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."" — The Wonderful
            Wizard of Oz, chapter 18, "Away to the
            South"</blockquote>
        <p>So she was the most beautiful of the four witches. Later books in Baum's Oz series refer to Glinda
            as a Sorceress, rather
            than a Witch.</p>
